+==================Payment==================+

It is very rare to find a Developer for little to no money, so here are my payment guidelines

» Discord Bots
	> One bot with some custom features: $0
	
	> One bot with a ticket system: $0
	
	> One bot with a ticket system, custom features, and moderation commands: $0 
		> If the amount of custom features exceeds 5, each extra feature will cost you one month of Nitro Classic each
	
	> One bot with an advanced ticket system, featuring my "Admin Ticket" system, custom features, and moderation commands
	
	> One bot with a chat filter, custom features, moderation commands, logging, and link/invite detection: 1-6 Months of Discord Nitro Classic (Depending on the amount of custom features)
	
	> Everything above, plus custom features for server donators/patrons: 6-12 Months of Discord Nitro Classic (Depending on the amount of donators/patrons)

- Final payment for the last 2 options is decided by the developer

- Certain payment exceptions will be discussed

- Each plan includes a "help command" listing every command the bot is capable of (at no extra charge)


+==================Extra Info==================+

- If any kind of malfeasance is detected, or the bot is used for malicious purposes, the token will be reset and the bot will be removed from the hosting program.

- Each custom bot is hosted with a 100% 24/7 secure hosting system

- All GitHub Repositories are private, ensuring your safety and the safety of your server's community

- All credit for the bot will be given to the developer

- Any edits of any kind found to the original source code will result in the bot being shut down

- Please be prepared to list the exact features you'd like, don't waste the developer's time

- If the developer at any time cannot complete the task provided, or feels uncomfortable completing the task, payment will be stopped and the bot will be shut down completely. This includes if the developer's knowledge limits them from completing the task at hand. (We will discuss other options if you do not want to shut down the bot)

- If you cannot afford your plan, I am willing to discuss other options.

- Options if you cannot afford the chosen plan include:
	> Downgrading to the plan below
	> Removing a few features, knocking down the price
	> Downgrading to the lower plan and giving credit in the actual server to the developer in the form of a "Bot Developer" role hoisted at least above the default member role
	> You do something for one of my multiple servers that I own, in the form of a staff role, management, graphic design, etc
	
	*I reserve the right to stop service at any time*
